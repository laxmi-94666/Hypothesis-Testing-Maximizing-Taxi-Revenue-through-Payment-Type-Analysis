# Hypothesis-Testing-Maximizing-Taxi-Revenue-through-Payment-Type-Analysis
This project analyzes NYC Taxi Trip data to explore how different payment methods (card vs. cash) impact fare amounts. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help maximize revenue for taxi drivers by identifying and encouraging the use of payment methods associated with higher fares.
